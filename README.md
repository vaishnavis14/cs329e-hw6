This project explores demographic shifts by focusing on the Baby Boomer generation (1946-1964) using U.S. Census data. I employ Python's Altair library to create interactive charts, including bar charts and sliders, to visualize the population's distribution by age, gender, and generation. Key features include a dynamic slider to track population trends over time and linked visualizations to analyze sex distribution across selected years and age groups.
